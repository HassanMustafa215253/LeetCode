# LeetCode
📘 LeetCode Practice Repository

This repository contains some of the LeetCode problems I have solved.
It does not represent a complete record of all questions I’ve done.

⚠️ Important Note

I often forget to save my solutions immediately, so many solved problems are not included here. This repository is mainly a reference for solutions I managed to document properly.

I followed a 🏃 100 Days LeetCode Marathon, which I successfully completed.
I initially saved solutions by day number, assuming it would be easy to track progress. However, over time I realized that saving by day number is not very useful for long-term reference so i changed to naming the questions by question number as per leetcode. All of the questions named after days are in "By Days" Folder. All of the new questions are included in the parent folder with other files.
